MATLAB Codes for manuscript "Frequency-Explicit Shape Uncertainty Quantification for Acoustic Scattering" by R. Hiptair, Ch. Schwab, and E.A. Spence.

Tested under MATLAB R 2019, but should work with any recent version of MATLAB

Just run the driver script _DriverScript_ and it will launch all the computations.
